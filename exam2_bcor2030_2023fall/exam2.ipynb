    "<span style=\"font-size:16px\">So, they decided to open up the beta test result of the new game at its pre-release version.

It is called probabilistic game items. To get the special game items, users should pay as much as $5 for each trial for the random roulette. But, some game users suspected that the KoKoaGames manipulated the probability of the probabilistic game items, and filed a lawsuit against the company requesting to publish the probability of each random game items. The court ordered to publish the probability of each item.</span> \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:16px\">KoKoaGames announced that the probability of popular game item called \"Sword of Knights\" is 2%, which means that once the users try the random roulette 50 times, then they can get the \"Sword of Knights\" just one time. The estimated cost of the \"Sword of Knights\" is then $250. But, in the users community, many users still didn't trust the announcement of the game company, and requested open testing of their self-claimed probability of the item.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:16px\">So, with a lot of press reporters and game users attended, KoKoaGames held an event to simulate random roulette for the \"Sword of Knights\". In this open event, they randomly created 300 mock accounts and alias in the game, and ran the random roulette for each alias. Load the data file, calculate mean, and standard deviation.</span>\n",
