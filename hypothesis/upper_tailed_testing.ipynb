    "Our hypothesized situation is calculating weight of new born babies. Thus, our population is the new born babies, population parameter is the average weight of the new born babies. We are interested in whether the average weight of the new born babies are more than 3kg or not. We set such a hypothesis because we assumed that because of the nutrition of the adult in country A was improved, there is a growing expectation of having heavier weight of new born babie\n",
